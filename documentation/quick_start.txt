Usage of fred.py is extremely simple. 
I recommend visiting https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/ and exploring their documenation. 
Although it is not thorough, requests are simple to construct. 

Before I list all of the function headers and return types, note that it is important 
to understand that this is not (quite) a standalone package. If you attempt to scrape 
massive amounts of data, you will usually hit a limit shortly. 
To avoid this, implement your own delays and limit protections. 

Currently, Fred is a class containing the functions. 
This may not remain that way. 

API Functions: 

def concatenate_url(self, parameters):
	Return type: URL constructed for XLM request 

def chunk_date_range(self, parameters):
	Return type: List of urls that fit the date range for FRED's limits
